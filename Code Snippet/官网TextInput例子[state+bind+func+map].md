`TextInput` is a basic component that allows the user to enter text. It has an `onChangeText` prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an `onSubmitEditing` prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.

For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "🍕🍕🍕".

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native';

class PizzaTranslator extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {text: ''};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{padding: 10}}>
        <TextInput
          style={{height: 40}}
          placeholder="Type here to translate!"
          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}
        />
        <Text style={{padding: 10, fontSize: 42}}>
          {this.state.text.split(' ').map((word) => word && '🍕').join(' ')}
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('PizzaTranslator', () => PizzaTranslator);
```
